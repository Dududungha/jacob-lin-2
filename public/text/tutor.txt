My very first job. 

I got paid a whopping $20.23/hr! I could not stop bragging to my friends about that.
But, what was more important to me than the pay was the fulfillment from helping and teaching my peers.
Seeing their eyes light up with understanding through the result of my help is a priceless feeling. 
Though it wasn't grand in scale, I felt that I was making an impact, a visible one, and I latched onto that desire.

From this, I knew that I had the capacity to help even more people, and looked for more opportunities.
